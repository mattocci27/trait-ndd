# `r s_append("method")` - Extended model description

We modeled the seedling survival for the dry and rainy seasons separately.
Since the effect of tree neighbors on seedling survival is nonlinear on a logistic scale [@Detto2019], we performed a grid-search for the scaling parameter *c* between 0 and 1 in 0.01 increments that maximized the likelihood of the following survival model,

$$
\mathrm{logit}(p_i) = b_0 + b_1 Z_{1i}^c + b_2 Z_{2i}^c,
$$

where $p_i$ is the survival probability of the *i*th individual, and $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are distance-weighted sums of basal areas of conspecifics and heterospecifics respectively.
We found that $c$ = 0.27 for the dry season and $c$ = 0.24 for the rainy season were the best estimates for our dataset (`r s_fig("cc_line")`).

We built Bayesian hierarchical models that include variation among species in the effects of conspecific and heterospecific neighbours, and rainfall on survival.
Survival ($s$) of seedling record *i* of individual *m* for species *j* in census *t* in plot *p* was modeled using the Bernoulli distribution ($\mathcal{B}$):

$$
s_{i,j,m,t,p} \sim \mathcal{B}(p_{i, j, t, p}),
$$

$$
\mathrm{logit}(p_{i,j,t,p}) = \boldsymbol{x_{i}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta_{j}} + \phi_p + \omega_t,
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta_{j}} = \left[\beta_{1,j}, \beta_{2,j}, \ldots, \beta_{K,j} \right]$ is the coefficient row *K*-vector for species *j*,
*K* is the number of predictors for an individual seedling,
$\boldsymbol{x_i} = \left[x_{i,1},x _{i,2}, \ldots,x_{i,K} \right]$ is the vector of predictors of size *K* for an individual seedling,
$\phi_p$ is the random effect for seedling plots, and
$\omega_t$ is the random effect for different censuses
(note that $\cdot$ denotes dot product).
The set of predictor variables ($\boldsymbol{x_i}$) includes
intercepts,
log of seedling heights,
rainfall,
densities of conspecific (*ConS*) and heterospecific (*HetS*) seedlings,
densities of conspecific (*ConA*) and heterospecific (*HetA*) trees that are scaled by 0.27 for the dry season or 0.24 for the rainy season,
and the interactions of rains with *ConS*, with *HetS*, with *ConA* and with *HetA*.
We also considered models with phylogenetic density effects instead of heterospecific density effects.

In the species-level regression, the row vector of coefficients ($\boldsymbol{\beta_{1-K}}$) of each species *j* were assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution through the Cholesky factorization [@StanDevelopmentTeam2021],

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta_j} = \boldsymbol{\gamma_k} \cdot \boldsymbol{u_j} + \mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{\tau})\cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega_L} \cdot \boldsymbol{z},
$$

where $\boldsymbol{u_{j}} = \left[u_{1,j}, u_{2,j}, \ldots, u_{L,j} \right]$ is the row vector of predictors of size *L* for species *j*,
*L* is the number of predictors for each species (i.e., the number of traits including an intercept),
$\boldsymbol{\gamma_k} = \left[\gamma_{k,1}, \gamma_{k,2}, \ldots, \gamma_{k,L} \right]$ is the coefficient *L*-vector for *k*th predictor in the individual-level regression,
$\mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{\tau})$ is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal vector of coefficient scales,
$\boldsymbol{\Omega_L}$ is the Cholesky factor of the original correlation matrix, which can be derived using a Cholesky decomposition for the covariance matrix of the original multivariate normal distribution,
$\boldsymbol{z}$ is a *K* $\times$ *J* matrix of latent Gaussian variables, and
*J* is the number of species.
We modeled five different sets of species-level predictors separately.
The set of species-level predictor variables ($\boldsymbol{u_j}$) includes
1)
LDMC,
SDMC,
LA,
SLA,
Chl,
LT,
$\delta$C~13~,
C,
N, and
$\pi$~tlp~,
2) abundance,
3) basal area, and
4) abundance and basal area.
The row vector $\gamma_{k,1}$ represents the average effects of each individual-level predictor (e.g., *ConS*) across species,
whereas $\gamma_{k, l}$ ($l \ne 1$), represents the effects of the *l*-th individual-level predictor (e.g., SLA) on the variation in the strength of each individual-level predictor (e.g., variation in the strength of *ConS* among species).
To allow comparisons among parameter estimates, the individual-level predictors ($\boldsymbol{x_i}$) and the species-level predictors ($\boldsymbol{u_j}$) were scaled to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 within each season and across species, respectively.

Posterior distributions of all parameters were estimated using the
No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an adaptive variant of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), algorithm implemented in Stan [@Carpenter2017] using the weakly-informative priors [@Gelman2008].
The HMC algorithm uses gradient information to propose new states in the Markov chain, leading to a more efficient exploration of the target distribution than traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that rely on random proposals [@Carpenter2017].
The NUTS algorithm automatically determines the number of Hamiltonian dynamics simulation steps needed to propose a new state in the Markov chain without requiring the user to set a fixed number of steps manually [@Hoffman2014].
Prior distributions for the species-level predictors ($\boldsymbol{\gamma_k}$) were independent normal distributions with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 2.5;
prior distributions for the latent Gaussian variables ($\boldsymbol{z}$) were independent standard normal distributions.
A prior distribution for the Cholesky factor of the correlation matrix ($\boldsymbol{\Omega_L}$) was the Cholesky LKJ correlation distribution with a parameter of 2 (which indicates matrices with smaller correlations).
Four independent chains were run for 1,000 iterations for each model with a warm-up of 2,000 iterations.
Convergence of the posterior distribution was assessed with the Gelman-Rubin statistic with a convergence threshold of 1.1 [@Gelman2013] and effective sample sizes > 400 [@Vehtari2021] for all parameters.
Divergent transitions were also monitored.
The existence of divergent transitions suggests that estimates are based on the incomplete exploration of the simulated Hamiltonian trajectory and are not trusted [@Betancourt2016].

All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.1 [@RCoreTeam2022] using the R package *targets* version 0.13.5 for workflow management [@Landau2021].
