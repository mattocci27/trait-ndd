Predicted result was generated from the best model in the rainy season (Table S8).
Color scales show marginal estimated median predictions for each response variable across the full range of rainfall and upper 90% quantiles of conspecific seedling density (the distributions of conspecific seedling densities are positively skewed).
All other variables were set at their mean value for marginal predictions.
Low and high trait values indicate 25% and 75% quantiles of the trait distribution in the observed dataset, respectively.
Only variables with credible intervals not overlapping 0 are plotted.

**`r s_table("dry_traits_diagnostics")`:**
Model selection and diagnostics for the dry season trait-based models.
Each model considers different aspects of rainfall effects:

- **No Rainfall**: Excludes rainfall effects.
- **Rainfall**: Includes rainfall effects without interactions.
- **All predictors × Rainfall**: Considers rainfall effects and all possible interactions.
- **ConS × Rainfall**: Focuses on the interaction between rainfall effects and conspecific seedling density.
- **ConT × Rainfall**: Focuses on the interaction between rainfall effects and conspecific tree density.
- **(ConS + ConT) × Rainfall**: Combines the interactions of rainfall effects with both conspecific seedling and tree densities.

Metrics Key:

- **ELPD**: expected log pointwise predictive density (larger values indicate better a model fit).
- **LOOIC**: leave-one-out deviance information criterion (smaller values indicate a better model fit).
- **N_ESS**: number of variables that showed effective sample size less than 400.
- **N_Div**: number of divergent transitions.

Models shown in grey are those with suboptimal convergence.

dry_traits_gamma <- read_csv(here("data", "dry_intrain2_nlog_gamma.csv"))
```

**`r s_table("dry_traits_gamma")`:**
Posterior medians and 95% credible intervals (CIs) of the effects of species-level predictors (traits) on individual-level predictors ($\gamma$) in the dry seasons, with Rhat values.
Bold values differ significantly from zero (the 95% CIs do not include zero).

Individual-level predictors include:

- ln Height: Natural logarithm of seedling height.
- ConS/HetS: conspecific/heterospecific seedling density.
- ConT/HetT: conspecific/heterospecific tree density (scaled by 0.27).
- Rainfall
- Interactions with Rainfall

Species-level predictors include:

 - Intercept: average effects across species (i.e., community-level effects).
 - LDMC: leaf dry matter content.
 - SDMC: stem dry matter content.
 - $\delta$C~13~: stable carbon isotope composition.
 - C: carbon concentration.
 - N: nitrogen concentration.
 - $\pi$~tlp~: leaf turgor loss point.
 - LA: leaf area.
 - SLA: specific leaf area.
 - LT: leaf thickness.

For example, the negative $\gamma_{3,1}$ (ConS at the individual-level and intercept at the species-level) reflects the negative conspecific density dependence (CNDD) of seedlings in the community-level.
In another example, the positive $\gamma_{3,3}$ (ConS at the individual-level and SDMC at the species-level) indicates the positive relationship between ConS and SDMC, suggesting that the strength of CNDD decreases with increasing SDMC.
