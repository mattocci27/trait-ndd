**Figure 1**
Standardized regression coefficients common to all species ($\gamma_{k,1}$) modeling the effects of
log of individual height (ln Height),
conspecific seedling density (ConS),
conspecific tree density (ConT),
heterospecific seedling density (HetS),
heterospecific tree density (HetS),
rainfall, and
interactions between densities and rainfall for dry and rainy seasons.
Thick and thin lines indicate 90% and 95% credible intervals, respectively.
Circles show posterior means of coefficients.
Filled circles indicate significant effects and open circles indicate non-significance effects.
Positive $\gamma_{k,1}$ values indicate higher survival rates with increasing values of the predictors,
while negative $\gamma_{k,1}$ values indicate lower survival rates with increasing values of the predictors.
Note that predictors are scaled to a mean of 0 andstandard deviation of 1 within each season.

**Figure 2**
Relatonships between species traits and individual-level predictors on survival rates in dry seasons.
Points and bars indicate posteriors means and 95% credible intervals (CIs) of coefficients for each species ($\beta_{k,j}$), respectively.
Slopes indicate the relative influence of functional traits on the response of species survival to each individual-level predictors ($\gamma_{k,l}$).
The 95% CIs are presented as the shaded area.
Note that the effecs of traits of not interest are controled for the slopes ($\gamma_{k,l}$) but not controlled for the points ($\beta_{k,j}$).
A-C: the species-specific response to conspecific seedling density (ConS; $\beta_{3,j}$) and its relationship with functional
(SDMC: stem dry matter content;
C: carbon concertration;
Chlorophyll: leaf chlorophyll content);
D-F: the species-specific response to rainfall ($\beta_{7,j}$) and its relationship with functional traits
(LDMC: leaf dry matter content,
$\delta$C~13~: stable carbon isotope composition,
$\pi$~tlp~: leaf turgor loss point);
G-J: the species-specific response to the interaction between ConS and rainfall ($\beta_{8,j}$) and its relationship with functional traits
(LDMC,
$\pi$~tlp~,
$\delta$C~13~,
ln LT: log of leaf thickness).

Relatonships between species traits and individual-level predictors on survival rates in rainy seasons.
Details as for Figure 2.
A-B: the species-specific response to rainfall ($\beta_{7,j}$) and its relationship with functional traits
(N: nitrogen concertraiont,
$\pi$~tlp~: leaf turgor loss point);
C-D: the species-specific response to the interaction between conspecific seedling density (ConS) and rainfall ($\beta_{8,j}$) and its relationship with functional traits
(N, $\pi$~tlp~).
