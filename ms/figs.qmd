**Figure 1**
Standardized regression coefficients common to all species ($\gamma_{k,1}$) modeling the effects of
log of individual height (ln Height),
conspecific seedling density (ConS),
conspecific tree density (ConT),
heterospecific seedling density (HetS),
heterospecific tree density (HetS),
rainfall, and
interactions between densities and rainfall for dry and rainy seasons.
Thick and thin lines indicate 90% and 95% credible intervals, respectively.
Circles show posterior means of coefficients.
Filled circles indicate significant effects and open circles indicate non-significance effects.
Positive $\gamma_{k,1}$ values indicate higher survival rates with increasing values of the predictors,
while negative $\gamma_{k,1}$ values indicate lower survival rates with increasing values of the predictors.
Note that predictors are scaled to a mean of 0 andstandard deviation of 1 within each season.

**Figure 2*
Predicted relationships during the dry seasons between the effects of conspecific seedling density (ConS) on seedling survivals and:
a) stem dry matter content (SDMC);
b) logarithm of abundance.
The strength of the CNDD effect caused by conspecific seedling density declined significantly with increased SDMC and abundance (with positive ConS values indicating weaker CNDD).
The line represents the predicted median of the relationship, the points show coefficients, and the vertical bars indicate 95% confidence intervals (for detailed parameter estimates, see Appendix S1: Table S5).

**Figure 3**
Relatonships between species traits and individual-level predictors on survival rates in rainy seasons.
Details as for Figure 2.
A-B: the species-specific response to rainfall ($\beta_{7,j}$) and its relationship with functional traits
(N: nitrogen concertraiont,
$\pi$~tlp~: leaf turgor loss point);
C-D: the species-specific response to the interaction between conspecific seedling density (ConS) and rainfall ($\beta_{8,j}$) and its relationship with functional traits
(N, $\pi$~tlp~).
